The program is intended to track statistics of my flights in X-Plane.


There is a pretty cool GUI displaying all completed flights

A simple schedule of upcoming 5 flights

Details of the flight and total statistics.

And also, the program can show you how you were flying, i.e. it shows all coordinates you've overflown. To start collection of coordinates, you'll have to 'open' the flight
before departing. X-plane will continuously send coordinates to the program via UDP on port 50000 (it have to be configured in X-Plane to send lat and lon to specified port)
until you press 'close the flight' button in schedule.
